            Many infants can develop irregular head shapes early in life, but
            only a very small number require urgent assessment by a physician.
            We want to make sure these infants are seen sooner rather than later.

            Other infants may not even require an in-person visit, saving families
            the hassle of a doctor's visit for something that would be considered
            normal. However, this will depend on the diagnosis and the quality of photos.

            By taking the time to capture the required photos of your child, you
            are not only helping to make your child's care more streamlined, you
            are also helping to ensure other children can also get assessed in a
            timely manner.
